Daily Coding Challenge: Movie List Challenge
1. Create an array of objects of your 5 favorite movies
a. Each movie object should have the following properties:
    - title, year, genre, description, imdbRating (yeah, you will need to check imdb)
b. Create a function that when called loops through your array and console.logs
the details for each of your movies
c. Create a function that will find a movie by it's title 
and then console.logs the details of the movie. 
The function should take a movieTitle parameter that lets you search by different titles
files to create: movie-list.html, movie-list.js
